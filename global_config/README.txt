These config files are your local copies of your global_config. These are used

when running your Blade locally.



By default the hosts are configured to connect to Liberator and Transformer on

localhost, but you can change this to point to remote servers if needed. Other

configuration can also be changed either to match your deployed configuration

or to make any changes needed to run locally.
